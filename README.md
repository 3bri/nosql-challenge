This is challenge assignment 12.  Working with document oriented Database software MongoDB.  The assignment consists of two parts:  (A) the creation of the initial database related to United Kingdom restaurant reviews and (B) analysis of that data.

Currently, I have completed the first part but will be submitting the second part of the assignment soon.  I was able to complete the first part based on the examples and assignments covered during class time.
